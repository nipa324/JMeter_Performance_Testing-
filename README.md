# JMeter_Load and Performance_Testing-
Load testing is a kind of performance testing which determines the system's performance under real life lead conditions. This testing determines how the application behaves when multiple users access simultaneously. This testing identifies the maximum operating capacity of an application. It determines whether the current infrastructure is sufficient to run the program. On load testing Jmeter plays an vital role because of Jmeter is :-
  -  Open source
  -  Built in java
  -  Highly extensible
  -  Comprehensive GUI
  -  Adding element is easy

The mostly highlighted part of Apache JMeter is comprehensive documentation, by it users can have clear idea about each and every steps performance of the program.
The #Load_Testing_Using_JMeter is odne on this "www.gozayaan.com" website.the operation I do to check the performance is : -
  -  Thread group
  -  Samplers
  -  Listeners
  -  Configuration
  -  Assertions
  -  Logical COntroller
  -  HTTP recording controller
  -  Pre-Processor
  -  Timer
  -  Configure-Elementn
  -  Parameterized 
  -  Dashboard Generation
  -  Load Testing in non-GUI mode (demo)
  -  Report generation on Dashboard
